        Hello, i'm Owyn Neville, a freshman studying Information Technology at Michigan Tech! I have loved
        all things technology since I got my first laptop at five years old. <br> <br> I love the hardware side of technology,
        putting together computers, servers, and configuring them to work as I wanted is what I have done in my freetime since I was around 5-6 years old.
        <br> <br>I also have experience in the software side of tech, with skills in:
    </p>
    <ul id = "skills">
        <li>HTML - Creating websites such as this, and other personal sites.</li>
        <li>CSS - Continued usage with HTML and Javascript.</li>
        <li>JS - Usage in front-end websites, but also with Node.JS for backend, and developing Discord bots.</li>
        <li>C# - Used to make games with Unity Game Engine for fun.</li>
        <li>Java - Learned in AP Computer Science, and in my college Programming class.</li>
    </ul>
    <p id = "main_text_lower" >

    with results such as this website, and others linked in my projects section. I have used C# through Unity,
    and Node.JS through developing Discord bots, one of which is also linked, and while hosting web servers off of my computer.
    I am currently growing my expertise in front-end coding and design to broaden my knowledge and skills.
